18. Method Overriding (runtime polymorphim): giving different implementations to the method

                        must happen in sub class

                        Access modifier must be same or more visible

                        return type, method name, parameters neeed to be same 

                        We can not override:
                            static, final, private


19. Final keyword: unchangable
        
        variables: can not be reassigned

        methods: can not be overriden

        classes: can not be inherited



20. OOP Abstraction: hiding the implementation details
                    putting the focus on essentials without worrying about the details

                    abstract method: method without the body
                                     meant to be overriden ( can not be private, static, final)


                 2 ways:
                        1. Abstract class: meant to be parent (can not be final)
                                          can not create object

                                    A class can only extends one abstract class

                        2. Interface: blue print of the class
                                     used for providing additional methods that the class needs
                                     meant to be implemented ( can not be final)
                                     can not create object

                                     A class can implement multiple classes

                                     variables: public static final by default

                                     methods: abstract method, static methods, default method


                Volume:
                    volume();

                Shape:
                    area();

                Circle extends Shape

                Square extends Shape

                Rectangle extends Shape

                Cube extends Shape implements Volume

                Cylinder extends Shape implements Volume

                Sphere extends Shape implements Volume


                In my framework:
                    Abstract class: BasePage, TestBase

                    Interface: 
                            Map
                            List & Set
                            WebDriver
                            JavaScriptExecuter
                            TakeScreenShot
                            WebElement
                            ...


22. OOP Polymorphism: ability of the object to take on many forms
                     There MUST be inheritance

                     parent class/interface being referenced to child objects

                     reference type decides whats accessible

                     WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();


                     in my frameowrk:
                        Driver:
                            WebDriver driver;

                            WebDriver getDriver()



23. Reference type castings:  There MUST be inheritance
            
            upcasting: casting smaller type to larger ( done implicitly)

                       //  WebDriver driver = (WebDriver) new ChromeDriver();


            down casting: casting larger type to smaller (done explicitly)



24. Exceptions: checked & unchecked
        
        checked: occurs during compile time

        unchecked: occurs during runtime

25. Exception handlings:
            
            1. try & catch: For both checked & unchecked exception

                    try{
                        exception code
                    }catch(ExceptionClass e){
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }finally{

                    }


            2. throws: used within method signature.
                       for checked exceptions ONLY

                        caller is reponsible for handling the exception


26. final vs finally vs finalize:
        
        final: keyword. can be used for variables, methods, and class

        finally: block. can be used with try & catch

        finalize: method. used for garbgage collector to collect the unrferenced objects



27. garbage collection: where all the unrefertenced objects goes to
    
            unreferenced objects:
               new object or null key is being assigned to the reference name



28. Collection: size is dynamic
                ONLY supports non-primitives
                Ready methods


        List(I): Accepts duplicates, Has index

                ArrayList(C): searching/retrieving the element is faster ( get() )

                LinkedList(C): adding/removing the element is faster (add(), addAll(), remove(), removeAll(), retainAll(), removeIf())

                Vector(C): Synchronized ==> thread-safe

                Stack(C): Synchronized ==> thread-safe. LIFO


        Set(I): Does not accepts duplicates, Does not have index

                HashSet(C): maintains the random order

                LinkedHashSet(C): maintains the insertion order

                TreeSet(C): maintains sorted (ascending) order


        Queue(I): Accepts duplicates, Does not have index, FIFO


        In my framework:
                List:  List of WebElements (findElements())
                       List of String
                       List of Map

                Set: Switch between Multiple tabs (getWindowHandles())


29 Iterable & Iterator:
