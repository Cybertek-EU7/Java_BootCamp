		17. OOP Inheritance
				IS A vs Has A
		

1. primitives:	int, double, char, boolean
		byte, short, int, long, float, double
		char, boolean


2. Primitive type castings
		
		1. implicit casting: casting smaller primitive type to larger (implicitly done)

		2. explicit casting: casting larger primitive type to smaller (explicitly done)


3. Wrapper classes: the objects that represents the primitives


4. String: immutable version char sequence
		
		"Java "
		 01234

		 Methods: charAt, length, trim, lowercase & uppercase, replace, substring, equals, contains, split, tochararray


5. StringBuilder vs StringBuffer: mutable char sequence

		StringBuilder: not Synchronized

		StringBuffer: Synchronized



6. Loops: repeated action

	for loop:
		for(initialization; Condition; Iterator ){
			statements
		}


	while loop:

		while(Condition){
			statements
		}


7. Array: supports both primitives & non-primitives
		  size is fixed
		  can be multi-dimensional: n dimensional array contains (n-1) dimensional arrays
		  has index


8. For Each Loop: There must be a data structure 
				 Iteration order is fixed


			for(DataType var  : Data Structure ){

			}


9. Custom method: Function
				 grouping a series of code fragments

				 improves the reusability of the codes


			 declare: 
			 	 Access-Modifier  Specifier   ReturnType  methodName(Parameter){

			 	 } 

			 	 Access Modifier: public, protected, default, private
			 	 Specifier: static, final, abstract, synchronized
			 	 Return Type: void, DataType
			 	 Parameter: DataType
			 	 methodName: any name



10. Method overloading: multiple methods sharing the same method name
						parameters must be different

						happens in same class
						return type, access mdoifeirs can be same or different


11. Constructor: special method, every class MUST have it
				 used for creating objects from the class
				 execution depends on the object


			 declare:
			 		Access_Modifier  ClassName(parameter){

			 		}


		Creating Object:
				new Constructor;


		in my framework:
				BasePage:
					public BasePage(){
						Pagefactory.initElements(driver, this)
					}


				@FindBy



12. Class & Objects: 
			
			class: class is a template of objects. where the objects came from

			object: Object is an instance of the class
					each objejct has its own memory


13. Static vs Instance: one copy vs Multiple copies

		static: belong to the class
				There is only ONE copy of static shared by all the objects

		instance: belongs to the object ONLY
				  There are multiple copies of insteance for the objects
				  Each object has it's own copy


14. Import Statements:

		regular import:
				import packageName.className;
				import packageName.*;

		static import: used for importing static varaibles & methods ONLY
				import static packageName.className.staticMember;
				import static packageName.className.*;


15. Access Modifiers: 
		
		public > protected > default > private

		public: always accessible at everywhere
		protected: always accessible within same package, also accessible to sub classes outside package
		default: accessible within same package ONLY
		private: accessible within same class ONLY


16. OOP: Object Oreinted Programming
		
		code reusability
		centralized structure
		prevents the duplication
		easy to maintain
		less memory usage
		clean


	Encapsulation: hiding the data by givig private AM
				   use public getter/setter to read/write the data

				   getter: read only
				   setter: write only

           in my framework:
                POJO class


17. Inheritance: building IS A relations between classes (parent/child)

			class A  extends  class B
				 sub 			   super


		 sub class: can inherit all the visible variables & methods from super class

		 super class: can not inherit anything from sub class
		 			 can ONLY contains common features between all sub classes

		 A class can extends oen class ONLY

		 A class can be extended by multiple classes


   In my framework:

		 TestBase:

		 		driver
		 		action

		 		@BeforeMethod{
		 			open the browser
		 			maximize the browser
		 			implicitwait
		 			...
		 		}


		 		@AfterMethod {
		 			quit
		 			report
		 			..
		 		}


 		TestClass1 extends TestBase

 		TestClass2 extends TestBase

 		TestClass3 extends TestBase

 		TestClass4 extends TestBase


	In my framework:
			BasePage:
					public BasePage(){
						Pagefactory.initElements(driver, this)
					}


			LogInPage extends BasePage

			PurchasePage extends BasePage

			...



	Is A relation vs Has A relation:

		class Animal{

		}

		class Dog extends Animal{  // Dog Is A animal

		}
 
		class Zoo{   // Zoo Has A Dog
			Dog
		}


		class Test{ // Test has A driver
			driver
		}



	   class Car{

	   }

	   class BMW extends Car{  // BMW IS A car
	   		Engine   // BMW Has A Engine
	   }

	   class Engine{

	   }
